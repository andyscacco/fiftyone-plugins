    --plugin-names @voxel51/brain
```

Refer to the [main README](https://github.com/voxel51/fiftyone-plugins) for
more information about managing downloaded plugins and developing plugins
locally.

## Configuration

You can optionally configure which license(s) models must be distributed under
in order to be made available by this plugin's operators by setting the
following
[plugin secrets](https://docs.voxel51.com/plugins/using_plugins.html#plugin-secrets):

```shell
export FIFTYONE_ZOO_ALLOWED_MODEL_LICENSES="MIT,Apache 2.0"
```

Run the following command to see the available models and their licenses:

```shell
fiftyone zoo models list
```

## Usage

1.  Launch the App:

```py
import fiftyone as fo
import fiftyone.zoo as foz

dataset = foz.load_zoo_dataset("quickstart")
session = fo.launch_app(dataset)
```

2.  Press `` ` `` or click the `Browse operations` action to open the Operators
    list

3.  Select any of the operators listed below!

## Operators

### compute_visualization

You can use this operator to create embeddings visualizations for your
datasets.

This operator is essentially a wrapper around
[compute_visualization()](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/brain.html#visualizing-embeddings):

```py
import fiftyone.brain as fob

fob.compute_visualization(dataset_or_view, brain_key=brain_key, ...)
```

where the operator's form allows you to configure the brain key and all other
relevant parameters.

### compute_similarity

You can use this operator to create similarity indexes for your datasets.

This operator is essentially a wrapper around
[compute_similarity()](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/brain.html#similarity):

```py
import fiftyone.brain as fob

fob.compute_similarity(dataset_or_view, brain_key=brain_key, ...)
```

where the operator's form allows you to configure the brain key and all other
relevant parameters.

### sort_by_similarity

You can use this operator to perform image/text similarity queries against any
similarity indexes on your dataset.

This operator is essentially a wrapper around
[sort_by_similarity()](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/brain.html#similarity):

```py
view = dataset.sort_by_similarity(query, brain_key=brain_key, k=k, ...)
```

This operator supports all of the following similarity queries:

-   Searching by
    [image similarity](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/brain.html#image-similarity)
    based on the currently selected samples in the App
-   Searching by
    [image similarity](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/brain.html#image-similarity)
    to an uploaded image
-   Searching by
    [text similarity](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/brain.html#text-similarity)

### add_similar_samples

You can use this operator to retrieve similar samples from another dataset to
add to your current dataset.

This operator is essentially a wrapper around the following pseudocode:

```py
view = src_dataset.sort_by_similarity(query, brain_key=brain_key, k=k)

dataset.add_samples(view)
```

This operator supports both image and text similarity queries, depending on
whether you have samples currently selected in the App when you launch the
operator:

-   If one or more samples currently selected, an
    [image similarity](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/brain.html#image-similarity)
    query will be performed to retrieve similar images from `src_dataset` to
    your currently selected samples in `dataset`
-   Otherwise, a
    [text similarity](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/brain.html#text-similarity)
    query will be performed to retrieve new images from `src_dataset` that
    match the provided text prompt

### compute_uniqueness

You can use this operator to compute uniqueness for your datasets.

This operator is essentially a wrapper around
[compute_uniqueness()](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/brain.html#image-uniqueness):

```py
import fiftyone.brain as fob

fob.compute_uniqueness(dataset_or_view, uniqueness_field, ...)
```

where the operator's form allows you to configure all relevant parameters.

### compute_mistakenness

You can use this operator to compute mistakenness for your datasets.

This operator is essentially a wrapper around
[compute_mistakenness()](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/brain.html#label-mistakes):

```py
import fiftyone.brain as fob

fob.compute_mistakenness(dataset_or_view, pred_field, label_field, ...)
```

where the operator's form allows you to configure all relevant parameters.

### compute_hardness

You can use this operator to compute hardness for your datasets.

This operator is essentially a wrapper around
[compute_hardness()](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/brain.html#sample-hardness):

```py
import fiftyone.brain as fob

fob.compute_hardness(dataset_or_view, label_field, ...)
```

where the operator's form allows you to configure all relevant parameters.

### get_brain_info

You can use this operator to get information about brain runs.

This operator is essentially a wrapper around
[get_brain_info()](https://docs.voxel51.com/api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.get_brain_info):

```py
info = dataset_or_view.get_brain_info(brain_key)
print(info)
```

### load_brain_view

You can use this operator to load the view on which a brain run was performed.

This operator is essentially a wrapper around
[load_brain_view()](https://docs.voxel51.com/api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.load_brain_view):

```py
view = dataset.load_brain_view(brain_key)
```

### rename_brain_run

You can use this operator to rename brain runs.

This operator is essentially a wrapper around
[rename_brain_run()](https://docs.voxel51.com/api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.rename_brain_run):

```py
dataset_or_view.rename_brain_run(brain_key, new_brain_key)
```

### delete_brain_run

You can use this operator to delete brain runs.

This operator is essentially a wrapper around
[delete_brain_run()](https://docs.voxel51.com/api/fiftyone.core.collections.html#fiftyone.core.collections.SampleCollection.delete_brain_run):

```py
dataset_or_view.delete_brain_run(brain_key)
```
